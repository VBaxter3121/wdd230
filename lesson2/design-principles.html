                <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
                <p>FutureDeluxe<br><br><a href="https://futuredeluxe.com/">futuredeluxe.com</a></p>
                <img src="images/white-space.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the 'Future Deluxe' website, showing lots of white space.">
                <p>This website examplefies good use of white space in its design, from the amount of empty space around the
                    text in the upper portion of the screen to the gaps around the image near the bottom of the screen. The
                    middle image lacks white space at the side, but that is because it is the banner image for the website.<br><br>
                    Even the spacing of the lines of text is a good example of how to give every element on the page plenty of
                    "breathing room", spacing them nicely apart instead of bunching them together.<br><br> The gap between the companies
                    name at the top of the screen and the heading below is very lager than you might think necessary, but by
                    including that extra space, there is less on the screen to distract you from the important content. In other
                    words, it focuses your attention on certain areas, and gives the page a clean appearance.

                <img src="images/visual-hierachy.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Sqaurespace website, demonstrating visual heirachy.">
                <p>While the irony of using a website building tool's website as an example is not lost on me, I believe this page
                    shows a good example of visual hierachy. The shape formed by the content on the page is larger on the top than
                    on the bottom, drawing your attention to the most important part at the top of the screen.<br><br> It does not clutter
                    the website with unecessary information, but states very simply what their purpose is (offering a service to
                    help build effective websites). Finally, the button at the bottom of the screen draws attention to itself by
                    being larger than the content immediately above it, and contrasting strongly with the background.

                <img src="images/rule-of-thirds.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Steam website, demonstrating the rule of thirds.">
                <p>The rule of thirds is shown on this website in a few areas. First of all, the menu options at the top of the
                    screen are all aligned to the left third of the screen. There is even a gradient changing the background colour
                    from light to dark, making the right hand third of the screen stand out from the other parts. <br><br>The sale
                    advertisement is split into three vertical sections spread across the length of the screen, and the large
                    text at the bottom is all within the bottom third of the viewport.
